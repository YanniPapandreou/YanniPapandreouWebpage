Some samples of my work are included below.

Early Stage Assessment
======

My ESA report on the work conducted during the first year of my PhD can be downloaded [here]({{ site.url }}/files/ESA_Yanni_Papandreou.pdf). This outlines my ongoing work on the Bayesian formulation of PDE-based models with an aim towards physics-informed machine learning.

MSc Thesis
======

My MSc Thesis can be downloaded [here]({{ site.url }}/files/My_MSc_Thesis.pdf). This outlines the summer research project I undertook under the supervision of [Dr Andrew Duncan](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.duncan) during my MSc. The project involved investigating the use of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for parameter inference in generative models based on ODEs. In particular, an adjoint method for gradient descent in high-dimensional parameter spaces was studied.
