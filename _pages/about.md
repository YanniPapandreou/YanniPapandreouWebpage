I am a second year PhD student in Statistics at Imperial College London, under the joint supervision of [Dr Andrew Duncan](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.duncan) and [Jon Cockayne](http://www.joncockayne.com/). I obtained an MSc in Statistics in 2019 from Imperial College London and a BA in Mathematics in 2018 from the University of Cambridge.

My current research is focused on the Bayesian formulation of PDE-based models with an aim towards physics-informed machine learning. I have also worked on kernel-based methods for inference of complex models.

I also have a [personal webpage](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/john.papandreou18) on the Imperial College website.
